# Notes on Haber Bosch Optimisation
----------------

## First of all, what is Haber Bosch Process?

It is a process used for creation of ammonia. It takes gases: N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) and H<sub>2</sub> (hydrogen) and creates NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia).

The heat this reaction producess is (Δ*H*<sub>rxn</sub> = −91.8 kJ/mol). Which means it is exothermic.







### Notes

>
> rxn = denotes that this change is the enthalpy of reaction

>
> enthalpy = Enthalpy ( H ) is the sum of the internal energy ( U ) and the product of pressure and volume ( PV ) given by the equation:
> H = U + PV
