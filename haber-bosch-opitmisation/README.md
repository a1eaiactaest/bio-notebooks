# Notes on Haber Bosch Optimisation
----------------

## First of all, what is Haber Bosch Process?

It is a process used for creation of ammonia. It takes gases: N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) and H<sub>2</sub> (hydrogen) and creates NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia).

The heat this reaction producess is (Δ*H*<sub>rxn</sub> = −91.8 kJ/mol). Which means it is exothermic, because value is negative.







### Notes

>
> rxn = denotes that this change is the enthalpy of reaction

>
> enthalpy = Enthalpy ( H ) is the sum of the internal energy ( U ) and the product of pressure and volume ( PV ) given by the equation:
> H = U + PV

> ## Entropy
> Entropy is a state function that is often erroneously referred to as the 'state of disorder' of a system. Qualitatively, entropy is simply a measure how much the energy of atoms and molecules become more spread out in a process and can be defined in terms of statistical probabilities of a system or in terms of the other thermodynamic quantities. Entropy is also the subject of the Second and Third laws of thermodynamics, which describe the changes in entropy of the universe with respect to the system and surroundings, and the entropy of substances, respectively.
